# Cloupeer

Cloupeer is an open-source, cloud-native control plane for orchestrating large-scale networks of distributed peers, designed to bridge the gap between your cloud and your physical infrastructure in IoT and Edge Computing.

Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, Cloupeer extends the power of Kubernetes beyond the data center to the physical world. It allows you to model your distributed peers—from IoT sensors to edge servers—as native Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs). This provides a unified and declarative API to automate the complete lifecycle of your hardware fleet.

Ultimately, Cloupeer transforms your vast collection of distributed peers into a single, cohesive, and programmable supercomputer, all managed with the battle-tested principles of cloud-native development.
