# Autopeer

Autopeer is an open-source, cloud-native control plane for orchestrating large-scale networks of distributed peers, designed to bridge the gap between your cloud and your physical infrastructure in IoV and Edge Computing.

Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, Autopeer extends the power of Kubernetes beyond the data center to the physical world. It allows you to model your distributed peers—from IoV sensors to edge servers—as native Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs). This provides a unified and declarative API to automate the complete lifecycle of your hardware fleet.

Ultimately, Autopeer transforms your vast collection of distributed peers into a single, cohesive, and programmable supercomputer, all managed with the battle-tested principles of cloud-native development.
